Grappling Hook and Chain -
Add the chain, a tile drawn multiple times to fill up the space between player and hook.

Implement more different effects, and possibly add the passive effect. Create some sort of ui that can handle it all.

Card ability system

At the end of each level, you have a chance to (or always?) collect a card (OR could be after certain points thresholds, making points more important, OR even both!), which may or may not have passive effects, and may or may not have immediate effects when used. (If no immediate effects, using it will simple get rid of it). These will give the player an edge as they go through the levels, and players will have to micro-manage these cards to choose the best one for the upcoming battle. 
Could extend this further to how enemies fight, or rather abilities enemies have, such as making you drop or lose cards, or even taking cards and trying to escape with them.
Abilities could also be negative effects (denoted below with an *)
